<p style= "font-size: 25px;"><u><b>The Issue of Urban Sprawl </u></b></p>

<p> Urban Sprawl is the expansion or migration of a population away from central urban areas <br>to low-density residential developments in new areas. <br><br> Urban Sprawl has a negative connotation attached to it due to the number of issues it causes.<br><br> The following are the most common impacts of Urban Sprawl:<br><br> 

- <i> Increased emissions: </i> <br><br>Longer travel times to and from work, as a result of living further away,<br> leading to greater motor vehicle emissions.<br><br> 

- <i> Greater social disconnectivity: </i> <br><br>Living in low-density residential developments reduces the opportunity <br>for interaction with others. Can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection. <br><br> 

- <i> Ecological footprint:</i><br><br> Consumption of large areas of land leads to a larger ecological footprint. <br>It consumes farming and agriculutral land, and causes a loss of wildlife habitat. <br><br> 

- <i> Poorer lifestyle: </i> <br><br>Living futher away from central urban areas increases the reliance on personal<br> motorvehicles. Studies have shown a decrease in physical activity and greater <br>health problems.  <br><br> 

- <i> Economical disparity: </i> <br><br>Wealthier people are able to move away from central urban areas due to their<br> higher buying power. Thus, the poorer populations are left behind and an <br>economical imbalance is created based on location.

<p style= "font-size: 25px;"><u><b>Urban Sprawl in Sydney </u></b></p>

<p>

Urban sprawl is prevalant in Sydney most predominantly occuring in the Western suburbs of Sydney. in currently occuring in the Western Suburbs of Sydney, <br>concentrated within the North West and South West regions. In these suburbs there has been an increase in low density living due to new residential<br> developments. Some of these suburbs include: Kellyville, The Ponds, Rouse Hill, Paramatta, Blacktown, Penrith, Campbelltown, and Liverpool.<br> The collection of data below provides evidence of Urban Sprawl in Sydney as it identifies the key characteristics and problems associated with Sprawl. 
<br><br>

<i> 1) <u> Population Density of Sydney: </i> </u>



<img src="1.png" style="width:46%; margin: 780px 0px 0px 0px"; />



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

From the Map it is clear that the population density decreases away from the central urban region of Sydney (Sydney CBD). <br>Larger areas of land are aquired as people move further away from Sydney due to availability. 



<br><br>



<p> <i> 2) <u> Density of types of Dwelling in Sydney: </i> </p> </u>

<img src="2.png" style="width:65%; margin: 1385px 0px 0px 340px;" />


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<p> 


From the Map it can be seen that there is a higher density of apartments in and around Sydney CBD (Inner East), and a lower density of houses.<br> However, shifting away to the Greater Western and Southern suburbs of Sydney, there is a sharp decline in the density of apartments as they are <br>been replaced by housing. This is a major characteristic of urban sprawl, as greater land availability away from central urban areas generally <br>correlates to an increase in housing developments.  

 </p>

<br>


<p> <i> 3) <u>  Number of Motorvehicles owned around Sydney: </i>  </u></p>



<img src="3.png" style="width:65%; margin: 1980px 0px 0px 340px;" />


<img src="4.png" style="width:65%; margin: 2355px 0px 0px 340px;" />


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p> 


Comparing the four maps we can see that a strong pattern has developed. Residents who live in or very close to Sydney CBD generally own a maximum <br>of only one motor vehicle, with a large population owning none. However, the reliance on motorvehicles increases further away from the CBD as single<br> households require up to three vehicles. This is an indication of public transport being time consuming and inconvienant to those living further away <br>from the CBD. This data also relates directly to the increased emissions produced by the Outer regions of Sydney, as well as the decrease in health<br> quality and lifestyle.

<p style= "font-size: 25px;"><u><b> Concept Design </u></b></p>

<p>

The issue of Urban sprawl can be resolved through appropriate urban planning. 
Our design, despite being quite radical, eliminates the problem or<br> Urban sprawl and creates a smarter, sustainable and functioning city. 

<br><br>

The design begins by grouping a number of small to medium sized suburbs into one larger division. The shape of the division will be circular as <br>shown in the diagrams. Each division is seperated from each other, however, still connected by high-speed transit 
(ie, bullet trains).<br> In total around Sydney there will be up to 10 divisions, catering for the whole population. 

<br><br>
Within each divison, there are three major componenents. Co-housing and mixed-use apartments make up the first two components. They are the <br>two types of dwellings residents can choose to live in. The dwellings are scattered around the third component which is a central business hub. <br>Four connected buildings will serve as the place for work for all the residents within the division. All necessary shops are also located in this <br>region, to cater for the needs of the residents.

<br><br>

The two major roads leading to the business hub are 'car-free', instead comprising of public transport (bus, light rail), bicycle lanes<br> and pedestrian walkways. 

<br><br>

<u> Benefits of the concept: </u>

<br><br>

- Within divisions, the maximum distance from one end to the business hub is 1-2km, allowing residents to walk or cycle to work. <br>
  Residents can also use public transport which will now be more convienant and less time consuming.<br> Leading to an overall <i> increase in health and lifestyle quality. </i>

  <br><br><br>

- <i> Reduced ecological footprint </i> since residents are living in higher densities. There is more land available for parks, agriculture, and animal habitats. 

<br><br><br>

- <i> Reduced emissions </i> as a result of 'car-free' roads and increased public transport. Creating a sustainable city. 

<br><br><br>

- <i> Co-housing </i> allowing greater opportunity for social interaction, whilst still providing privacy to residents and a feeling of a home.
